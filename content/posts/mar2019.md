# General Information

[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/)'s mission is to help
scientists and engineers get more research done in less time and with less
pain by teaching them basic lab skills for scientific computing.
This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools, including program
design, version control, data management, and task automation.
Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have
learned to their own research problems.

*For more information on what we teach and why, please see our paper
"[Best Practices for Scientific Computing](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745)".*
